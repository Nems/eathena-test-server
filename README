This is just our eAthena version. We store our scripts, items and monster databases, etc.
in a separate git repository called tmw-ufb, available at:

 http://gitorious.org/tmw-ufb

Note that this repository contains more than just the contents of this data
directory. Either set up symbolic links or just copy the server executables
into it.
