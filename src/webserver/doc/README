This readme is intended for the programmers of eAthena.

This webserver's apis are in API.txt.

To make this simple, generate.c should handle most of the work this sever does
in terms of what people see.

When a request is made the server shoots it off to generate.c.

You are welcome to create more functions used by generate.c to generate pages
though, so don't feel limited by that one file.
